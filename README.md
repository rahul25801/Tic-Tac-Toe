# Tic-Tac-Toe
The tic tac toe game is a strategic game played with two players. The tic tac toe game can also be played on a computer by implementing the game using the C++ programming language. The implementation of the tic tac toe game in C++ will be a great project to understand the concepts of C++ and apply them in real-life scenarios.

What are We Building?
We will be building a tic tac toe C++ game that can be played by a single player and a computer or with two players from the terminal. The C++ programming language is used to build the game.

How to Play this Game?
The tic tac toe proceeds by the following rules of the game,

There are two players in the game. The game board is a table with an equal number of rows and columns. The most used game board will be of the 3 X 3 dimension.

A player can select either an X symbol or an O symbol to play the game.
A player starts his play by marking his symbol in any of the cells on the table. Then another player performs the same with another cell in the table. A cell that is marked with a symbol can't be changed throughout the game.
The winner of the game is declared when three cells in the horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions have been consecutively marked by the same symbol.
The game continues with alternative turns till all the cells are filled which indicates a draw or a winner is reached.


Pre-Requisites
The following concepts should be known to implement tic tac toe in C++,
Functions are used to break down the code to make the code more user-readable and reusable. Learn more about functions in C++.
Different data types are used to store the values used throughout the project. Learn more about data types in C++.
Conditional statements are used to take different actions based on the response made by the user. Learn more about conditional statements in C++.
Jump Statements are used in the last part of the program to prevent errors. Jump statements are used to jump over a piece of code. Learn more about Jump statements in C++.
Loops are used to repeat the same action until a winner or a draw is reached. Learn more about Loops in C++.
The concept of Object Oriented programming is implied to create objects for the player and game. Learn more on OOPS in C++.

How are We Going to Build the Tic Tac Toe Game Using C++?
The following steps are followed to build the tic tac toe game in C++,

Creating two classes for the player and the game board.
Creating functions to create the game board and display the game board.
Implementing functions to select the mode of the game, either single or two players.
Creating functions to get input from the player to mark the symbol of the player on the cell.
Implementing the logic to make the move by computer.
Creating functions to check if there is a winner in the game.
Allowing multiple iterations until the game ends in a draw or a winner is reached.
